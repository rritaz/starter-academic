I am a PhD candidate in [Statistics](https://statistics.northwestern.edu/) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) and a member of the [Statistics for Evidence-Based Policy and Practice (STEPP) Center](https://sites.northwestern.edu/steppcenter/about/) lab. My research is centered on statistical methods for meta-analysis, with a particular focus on small samples, and effect sizes and effect size estimation in randomized and quasi experiments. This work is motivated by applications in the social sciences.
