I am a PhD candidate in [Statistics](https://statistics.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University and a member of the [Statistics for Evidence-Based Policy and Practice (STEPP) Center](https://sites.northwestern.edu/steppcenter/about/) based at the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern. 

My research interests are in the development and use of meta-analysis methods for evidence-based policy and practice in education, medicine and the social sciences. I also seek to understand problems in the formulation of effect sizes and effect size estimators in randomized experiments and quasi-experimental designs, particularly when primary studies adjust for covariates.
