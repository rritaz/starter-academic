I am a Statistician and a Clinical Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Illinois Chicago, with appointments in the [School of Public Health, Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics](https://publichealth.uic.edu/) (primary) and the [College of Applied Health Sciences](https://ahs.uic.edu/) (joint).

My research interests are in the use and development of statistical methods and tools to support policy-making. This includes 
- the quantification of uncertainty of point estimates from predictive models
- the formulation of effect sizes and effect size estimators in randomized and quasi-experiments when adjusting for covariates, and
- extensions of meta-analysis methods to small sample situations.
I am also interested in generating empirical evidence about how policy-makers and practitioners make decisions currently, and designing tools that better support their decision-making processes. 

To date, I have worked in a range of substantive areas, including:
- Statistical support for refugee populations
- Combining and communicating air quality data for community empowerment 
- Sport epidemiology
- Mobility improvement among the aging population and people with neurological disorders
- Lifestyle interventions that promote mental health
- Understanding physiological mechanisms governing skeletal muscle blood flow during physical activity.
