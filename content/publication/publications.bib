 abstract = {In this special issue, we aim to lay the groundwork for statistical support for refugee populations. We hope this special issue will serve as a valuable resource for the statistics community. We also want to highlight the broader value of statistics and data science for public good– this issue serves as a compelling example of how our discipline can contribute meaningfully to long-term societal change. The papers in this special issue are based on longerform academic papers written by graduate and undergraduate students in Duke University’s Bass Connections program, which focused upon the Middle East and North Africa.},

@article{art-siff-EJAP-2025,
 abstract = {Introduction
Peripheral arterial stiffness measured with pulse wave velocity (PWV) is reduced 5-min after an acute bout of dynamic exercise. The mechanism for the reduction in peripheral arterial stiffness is unknown. We hypothesized that increased blood flow and compression of the vasculature are potential mechanisms involved in post-exercise reduction in peripheral arterial stiffness.

Methods
Brachial-radial PWV was measured with tonometers on the exercising arm of 20 healthy young volunteers (10 females, 30 ± 5 yrs, mean ± SD) before and after 5 min of rhythmic handgrip exercise at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), 50% MVC, and a 5 min set of passive forearm compressions. Brachial blood flow was monitored with Doppler ultrasound during exercise/compression.

Results
Brachial-radial PWV was lower than baseline at 5 min post (p < 0.001) for 30% MVC, 50% MVC, and compression, with responses similar among all conditions (p > 0.05). PWV remained lower than baseline at 15 min and 30 min only for 50% MVC. Blood flow and changes in brachial diameter during exercise/compression were not factors in the PWV reduction (p > 0.05).

Conclusion
These findings suggest that compression of the forearm vasculature contributes to the initial reduction in peripheral PWV after handgrip exercise, but the reductions in peripheral PWV are not associated with changes in blood flow.},

@article{rva-small-ma-smd,
 abstract = {This article considers the synthesis of standardized mean differences using a random-effects framework in the case of few studies. While random-effects methods produce efficient estimates and confidence intervals for the summary effect have correct coverage when the number of studies is sufficiently large, we demonstrate that conventional methods result in confidence intervals that are not wide enough when the number of studies is small, depending on the configuration of sample sizes across studies, degree of true heterogeneity and number of studies. We introduce two alternative variance estimators with better small sample properties, investigate degrees of freedom adjustments for computing confidence intervals, and study their effectiveness via simulation studies.},

@article{effect-sizes,
 abstract = {It is common practice in both randomized and quasi-experiments to adjust for baseline characteristics when estimating the average effect of an intervention. The inclusion of a pre-test, for example, can reduce both the standard error of this estimate, and – in non-randomized designs – its bias. At the same time, it is also standard to report the effect of an intervention in standardized effect size units, thus making it comparable to other interventions and studies. Curiously, the estimation of this effect size including covariate adjustment has received little attention. In this article, we provide a framework for defining effect sizes in designs with a pre-test (e.g., difference-in-differences and analysis of covariance) and propose estimators of those effect sizes. The estimators and approximations to their sampling distributions are evaluated using a simulation study and then demonstrated using an example from published data.},

@article{aggregate_metrics,
 abstract = {Several programs of research have sought to assess the replicability of scientific findings in different fields, including economics and psychology. These programs attempt to replicate several findings and use the results to say something about large-scale patterns of replicability in a field. However, little work has been done to understand the analytic methods used to do this, including what they are assessing and what their statistical properties are. This article examines several methods that have been used to study patterns of replicability in the social sciences. We describe in concrete terms how each method operationalizes the idea of "replication" and examine various statistical properties, including bias, precision, and statistical power. We find that some analytic methods rely on an operational definition of replication that can be misleading. Other methods involve more sound definitions of replication, but most of these have limitations such as large bias and uncertainty or low power. The findings suggest that we should use caution interpreting the results of such analyses and that work on more accurate methods may be useful to future replication research efforts.},

 abstract = {Students come to the learning of categorical association with many misconceptions. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of novel curriculum materials to improve mathematics teachers’ knowledge of students’ conceptions regarding categorical association. Results showed that prior to use of the materials, teachers’ knowledge was mostly limited to variations on one misconception. Following use of the materials, they were more broadly aware of a number of different misconceptions and improved their ability to analyze categorical data for association.},
