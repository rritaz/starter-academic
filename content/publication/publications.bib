@Article{more_than_one_replication,
	abstract = {The problem of assessing whether experimental results can be replicated is becoming increasingly important in many areas of science. It is often assumed that assessing replication is straightforward: All one needs to do is repeat the study and see whether the results of the original and replication studies agree. This article shows that the statistical test for whether two studies obtain the same effect is smaller than the power of either study to detect an effect in the first place. Thus, unless the original study and the replication study have unusually high power (e.g., power of 98\%), a single replication study will not have adequate sensitivity to provide an unambiguous evaluation of replication.},

@Article{history_of_rcts,
	abstract = {Background and purpose: Studies of education and learning that were described as experiments have been carried out in the USA by educational psychologists since about 1900. In this paper, we discuss the history of randomised trials in education in the USA in terms of five historical periods. In each period, the use of randomised trials was motivated by the research interests and conditions of the era. We have characterised these periods in terms of decades with sharp boundaries as a convenience.

	Sources of evidence and main arguments: Although some of the early studies used random allocation (and even random allocation of clusters such as schools), early researchers did not clearly understand the role of randomisation or clearly distinguish it from methods such as alternation. In 1940, E. F. Lindquist published an important book whose goal was to translate R. A. Fisher's ideas into language congenial to education researchers, but this had little impact on education research outside of psychology. There was a substantial increase in the number of randomised trials during the period from 1960 to 1980, as the US government enacted and evaluated a variety of social programmes. This was followed by a dramatic decrease during the period from 1980 to 2000, amid debates about the relevance of randomised trials in education research. The creation of the US Institute of Education Sciences in 2002 provided major financial and administrative support for randomised trials, which has led to a large number of trials being conducted since that time.

	Conclusions: These developments suggest that there is a promising future for randomised trials in the USA. American education scientists must remain committed to explaining why evidence from randomised field trials has an indispensable role to play in making wise decisions about education policy and advancing our capacity to improve education for a productive workforce and a successful society.},

@Article{replication_meta-analytic_perspectives,
	abstract = {Formal empirical assessments of replication have recently become more prominent in several areas of science, including psychology. These assessments have used different statistical approaches to determine if a finding has been replicated. The purpose of this article is to provide several alternative conceptual frameworks that lead to different statistical analyses to test hypotheses about replication. All of these analyses are based on statistical methods used in meta-analysis. The differences among the methods described involve whether the burden of proof is placed on replication or nonreplication, whether replication is exact or allows for a small amount of "negligible heterogeneity," and whether the studies observed are assumed to be fixed (constituting the entire body of relevant evidence) or are a sample from a universe of possibly relevant studies. The statistical power of each of these tests is computed and shown to be low in many cases, raising issues of the interpretability of tests for replication.},

@Article{assessing_heterogeneity,
	abstract = {In this study, we reanalyze recent empirical research on replication from a meta-analytic perspective. We argue that there are different ways to define 'replication failure,' and that analyses can focus on exploring variation among replication studies or assess whether their results contradict the findings of the original study. We apply this framework to a set of psychological findings that have been replicated and assess the sensitivity of these analyses. We find that tests for replication that involve only a single replication study are almost always severely underpowered. Among the 40 findings for which ensembles of multisite direct replications were conducted, we find that between 11 and 17 (28\% to 43\%) ensembles produced heterogeneous effects, depending on how replication is defined. This heterogeneity could not be completely explained by moderators documented by replication research programs. We also find that these ensembles were not always well-powered to detect potentially meaningful values of heterogeneity. Finally, we identify several discrepancies between the results of original studies and the distribution of effects found by multisite replications but note that these analyses also have low power. We conclude by arguing that efforts to assess replication would benefit from further methodological work on designing replication studies to ensure analyses are sufficiently sensitive.},

@Article{reconsidering_metrics,
	abstract = {Recent empirical evaluations of replication in psychology have reported startlingly few successful replication attempts. At the same time, they have noted that the proper way to analyze replication studies is far from a settled matter and have thus analyzed their data in several different ways. This presents two challenges to interpreting the results of these programs. First, different analysis methods assess different operational definitions of replication. Second, the properties of these methods are not necessarily common knowledge; it is possible for a successful replication to be deemed a failure by nearly all of the metrics used, and it is not always immediately clear how likely such errors are to occur. In this article, we describe the methods commonly used in replication research and how they imply specific operational definitions of replication. We then compute the probability of false failure (i.e., a successful replication is concluded to have failed) and false success determinations. These are shown to be high (often over 50\%) and in many cases uncontrolled. We then demonstrate that errors are probable in the data to which they have been applied in the literature. We show that the probability that some conclusions in the literature about replication are incorrect can be as high as 75-80\%.},

@Article{microsuppression,
	abstract = {States often turn to a data masking procedure called microsuppression in order to reduce the risk of disclosing student records when sharing data with external researchers. This process removes records deemed to have high risk for disclosure should they be released. However, this process can lead to analyses that differ from those conducted on the complete (unmasked) data, especially if the records that are released reflect different types of students than those that are suppressed. This paper assesses the extent to which microsuppression can bias parameter estimates, and finds that while marginal test score means tend to be preserved in the masked data, conditional means for subgroups can exhibit bias as large as 0.3 standard deviations.},

@article{aggregate_metrics,
 abstract = {Several programs of research have sought to assess the replicability of scientific findings in different fields, including economics and psychology. These programs attempt to replicate several findings and use the results to say something about large-scale patterns of replicability in a field. However, little work has been done to understand the analytic methods used to do this, including what they are assessing and what their statistical properties are. This article examines several methods that have been used to study patterns of replicability in the social sciences. We describe in concrete terms how each method operationalizes the idea of "replication" and examine various statistical properties, including bias, precision, and statistical power. We find that some analytic methods rely on an operational definition of replication that can be misleading. Other methods involve more sound definitions of replication, but most of these have limitations such as large bias and uncertainty or low power. The findings suggest that we should use caution interpreting the results of such analyses and that work on more accurate methods may be useful to future replication research efforts.},
