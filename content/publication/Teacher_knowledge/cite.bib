 abstract = {Students come to the learning of categorical association with many misconceptions. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of novel curriculum materials to improve mathematics teachers’ knowledge of students’ conceptions regarding categorical association. Results showed that prior to use of the materials, teachers’ knowledge was mostly limited to variations on one misconception. Following use of the materials, they were more broadly aware of a number of different misconceptions and improved their ability to analyze categorical data for association.},
