I am currently a Clinical Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Illinois Chicago, with joint appointments in the [School of Public Health, Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics](https://publichealth.uic.edu/) and the [College of Applied Health Sciences](https://ahs.uic.edu/). 

My research interests are in the use and development of statistical methods and tools to support policy-making. This includes the quantification of uncertainty of point estimates from predictive models, the formulation of effect sizes and effect size estimators in randomized and quasi-experiments when adjusting for covariates, and extensions of meta-analysis methods to small sample situations. I am also interested in generating empirical evidence about how policy-makers and practitioners make decisions currently, and designing tools that better support their decision-making processes.
